# Neural-Network-Common-Frameworks
Based on Tensorflow 2.xx, each model of NN is collected from the Internet
Here include, 

**AutoEncoder**, which use Autoencoder to classify the Mnist dataset.

**GAN_Org**, which is the version refers to *2014 Goodfellow's* paper work, using GAN and Autoencoder to learn and imitate the Mnist dataset.

**LSTM**, a LSTM classifier model with inout 3-d tensor (batch_size, timesteps, data_dim) and output numeric categories. 

**mnist_run**, which only contain 2 layer NN with 28*28 binary imagines input and 10 numeric categories output from 0 to 9.

**sgd**, a 2-d imaginary convolution classifier model with inout 2-d tensor (batch_size, timesteps) and output numeric categories, using SGD optimizer.
